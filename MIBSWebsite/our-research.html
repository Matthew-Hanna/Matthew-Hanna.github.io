      <h2>Development of an in vitro model for the Prediction of Cardiopulmonary Bypass Bleeding Outcomes</h2>
      <h3>Cardiopulmonary bypasses (CPB) frequently result in excessive bleeding, and consequently this surgery contributes to 10-15% of the national blood demand. This is caused by convoluted mechanisms, and is patient-variable, necessitating complex prediction methods. However, the main causes are believed to be platelet dysfunction, hyperfibrinolysis and coagulopathy. Coagulopathy specifically, is associated with the duration and complexity of the surgery, hemodilution, anti-platelet therapies, shear stress induced by the CPB flow conditions, blood-air and biomaterial interfaces, comorbidities, heparin and protamine doses, and genetics. The prediction of this phenomena is essential as it could potentially be utilized to inform treatment decisions, signal the need for prophylactic and preventative measures, ensure the necessary blood for transfusion is prepared, and overall, improve the patient’s care. Currently, platelet function testing (PFT) is the technique used to coordinate surgeries for patients on antiplatelet therapy, and to improve transfusion algorithms since CPB-induced coagulopathy is not observed by other assays. Unfortunately, this test’s predictive sensitivity is merely 70%, generating a high rate of false positives, diminishing its clinical value. This is a consequence of the fact that these tests are conducted under resting conditions and that platelets experience changes during surgery which preoperative testing does not account for. Consequently, a prototype was designed to mimic the stresses that blood experiences during CPBs in vitro and in the future will be used on the blood of volunteers. After comparing these results with post-operative CPB results, the device will be modified to more accurately predict patient-based outcomes. If this is successful, a point-of-care testing device will be designed.

      <h3> In this study research was conducted to evaluate the ability of contact lenses to uptake and release glaucoma drugs in vitro. This experiment was conducted by allowing different contact lenses to soak in solutions of glaucoma drugs for 24 hours. Afterwards, the lenses were placed on one of three models, a monolayer with human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs), a multilayer with HCECs, and a PET insert without any cells. Over 48 hours, the drug diffusion was calculated periodically for each of the contact lens types and was repeated in different mediums. Previous literature has demonstrated that this method has a low potential for drug administration, and that hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the contact lens material is the determining factor for adsorption. However, most of these studies have only been conducted on deionized water, phosphate buffered saline, and artificial tear solutions. Sources also state that the amount of drug released is also significantly greater in vivo than in vitro. In total, the results demonstrated that in cell-based in vitro models, the drug release is significantly higher than models without cells even when using different media in the no-cells model, and a dead-cell model. Regardless, only 2-3% of the drug adsorbed by the contact lens was released after 24 hours. Nonetheless, more drug may possibly be released from silicon hydrogels making them potentially useful for an ocular drug delivery system in the future. Overall, this research exemplifies the importance of cell models for the study of drug release in instances where the drug must be metabolized before being diffused within the tissue. In the future, a Tear Replenishment System will be deployed in our studies to more accurately simulate the dynamic environment characteristic to the front of the eye.

      <h3> Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) invade the cornea while the eye is closed. A closed-eye environment is also known to induce hypoxia, tear components, and interactions with corneal epithelial cells, which could be responsible for the difference between tear PMNs and blood-isolated PMNs. This study was conducted to determine if, by exposing blood-isolated neutrophils to this environment that they could mimic the tear-film neutrophils to develop improved in vitro models to more accurately study ocular inflammation. In this experiment, tear PMNs were collected from donors via having the volunteers wash the PMNs off their corneas immediately after waking up and collecting them in a test tube. Meanwhile, blood was also collected, and the neutrophils were isolated from these samples. The tear PMNs were immediately stimulated with LPS (known to induce inflammation), PMA (synthetic endotoxin and inflammatory stimulant), and fMLP (cytokine for activation) and analyzed with flow cytometry to determine certain gene expressions. Afterwards, the isolated neutrophils were exposed to FBS and ATS, half of which were immediately tested in the same manner as the tear PMNs. Meanwhile, the other half of these neutrophils were exposed to hypoxia normoxia and were allowed to interact with human corneal epithelial cells for 6 hours. Immediately afterwards, they were tested in the same fashion. Once the cellular data was observed, it was clear that the experiment did not cause the isolated neutrophils to mimic the tear film neutrophils. However, the experiment demonstrated that exposure to human corneal epithelial cells, incubation time, and different media do induce significant changes to isolated neutrophils. Regardless of these results, future experiments will be conducted as the development of tear film neutrophil models are essential to study material interactions in the cornea in vitro.

      <h3>It is known that chemical signals can induce cellular proliferation, differentiation, and directional migration, as well as mechanical signals such as stress and the properties of the substrate that the cells interact with. These mechanical signals are especially interesting in the study of keratoconus, a corneal condition which involves mechanical changes such as corneal thinning and consequently decreased mechanical stability and elastic modulus. Hence, this study was conducted to determine if these mechanical alterations elicit changes in the cellular environment, specifically changes to the elastic modulus. To do so, human corneal epithelial cells were cultured on substrates with differing elastic moduli, and were subsequently studied regarding their viability, cytoskeletal structure, adhesion molecule expressions, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. The variant elastic moduli were constructed via the use of differing concentrations of polyacrylamide. Afterwards, it was determined through analysis that this biomaterial was not toxic by conducting a cell viability test, while altering the elastic moduli affected the cytoskeletal structure of the cells. Specifically, the compliant substrate resulted in the crumbling of actin fibers and a disrupted overall structure, while the cells cultured on a stiff substrate expressed stretched and well-organized actin fibers. Through the video above, it was observed that the lack of organization and the deterioration of the actin fibers directly affected the migratory behavior of the cells in the softer substrate. Meanwhile, the apoptosis assay revealed that substrates with decreased mechanical properties had an increased rate of apoptosis, while the differing substrates did not change the levels of adhesion molecules or the molecules associated with an inflammatory response. Overall, this study determined that substrates with a relatively low stiffness induce apoptosis and disrupt actin fibers and as a result disrupted migration, which prompts further research involving the context of keratoconus.

      <h2>Infrared Therapy in Healthy and Diabetic Conditions</h2>
      <h3>While corneal epithelial and other epithelial tissues are similar, they are certainly not identical. Unfortunately, corneal epithelial tissue heals significantly slower, leading to seemingly everlasting visual complications. To make things worse, 2% of natural, complete wound healing processes lead to corneal abnormalities. While there are therapeutic technologies currently available, many patients are reluctant to utilize them as they are invasive, expensive, and inconvenient. This is especially regrettable for diabetics as they experience even slower corneal wound healing, and an increased risk of post-surgical complications. Thus, one of our current projects has been to study an alternative method of wound healing therapy, infrared radiation. In the past, studies have demonstrated that certain wavelengths of infrared radiation can stimulate the mitochondria of different tissues, leading to an increase in ATP production, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxides, and calcium ions. While some of these side-effects are considered harmful individually, the overall increases in cellular proliferation, and consequently wound healing indicate that these increases are negligible. Therefore, we are determining whether these effects can be observed in the corneal epithelium as well to improve the wound healing rate of diabetic, and otherwise healthy patients alike. Through our experiments we have been studying the physical and chemical properties of scraped human corneal epithelial cells that have either been exposed to a standard growth environment, or an environment with increased glucose to reflect diabetic conditions, along with different fluencies and wavelengths of infrared radiation. In total, we hope our results, using a more complex corneal model will be successful in vitro, and eventually in vivo to improve the corneal wound healing process for everyone, including diabetics.

      <h2 title="Link to Research">A Comprehensive Evaluation of the OcuCell In Vitro Testing Device</h2>
      <h3> For the general population, contact lenses are merely pieces of plastic that correct eyesight. However, engineers are attempting to achieve a paradigm shift in the way contacts are seen by the public as they are working to develop contact lenses with diagnostic, therapeutic, and monitoring capabilities. However, for these technologies to be approved they must be biocompatible. Hence, there is a growing demand for advanced in vitro models capable of assessing ocular surface toxicity and the biocompatibility of these future innovations. The objective of this study was to develop an in vitro cell culture system to replicate the tear flow between the eyeball and the eyelid with OcuCell. The experiment was conducted by first synthesizing a silicone eyelid and eyeball on which cells were grown for a period of 4 days. Next, the OcuCell was assembled and the silicone pieces were added. Once the device was prepared, the cellular response was characterized with flow cytometry after, 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of running the device. After MTT and XTT testing, it was discovered that the cells were able to grow to an even confluence on the silicone eyelid pieces, and that the device does not lead to cell death. Furthermore, the use of flow cytometry to evaluate cellular expressions demonstrated upregulated integrin a3 and b1 expressions, which was believed to be the result of the low shear stress induced by the flow of the artificial tear fluid. After further testing the apparatus with contact lenses soaked in PBS, no contact lenses, and a positive control contact lens designed to kill cells, it was determined that the OcuCell system is a formidable in vitro testing device for contact lenses as it mimics the essential ocular parameters of cells and tear flow, generating more meaningful results.
