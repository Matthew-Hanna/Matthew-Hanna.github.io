          <h2>Maud Gorbet, <br> Biomedical Engineer</h2>
          <h3>With a Ph.D. in Biomedical/Medical Engineering, and expansive research experience as seen through her wealth of research papers and innovations, Dr. Gorbet is well equipped for her position as the Material Interaction with Biological Systems laboratory director. Dr. Gorbet is dedicated to aiding millions of people by solving biocompatibility complications between biomaterials and biomedical devices, as well as therapeutics. Through her research, she has published a series of papers which have benefitted the biomedical community by providing the information and insight necessary to develop novel biomaterials, biomedical devices, and therapeutics, and has provided them with improved in vitro models, which more accurately mimic biological systems to ensure that innovations are successful when implemented in the industry. Meanwhile, as biomedical engineering department director and associate professor at the University of Waterloo, Dr. Gorbet is dedicated to ensuring that the future of biomedical engineering is worth being optimistic about, and that her legacy of biocompatibility will be maintained for years to come.

          <h2>Parisa Hamilton, <br> Chemical Engineer</h2>
          <h3>Through a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering at the University of Tehran, a master’s degree in chemical engineering, and a PhD in nanotechnological chemical engineering at the University of Waterloo, Dr. Hamilton has acquired the knowledge necessary to excel at the MIBS lab. Not only that, she has procured wisdom through working as a research associate at the University of Waterloo, completing numerous projects. For instance, her doctoral thesis focused on the development of self-assembling peptide based nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery to stabilize hydrophobic drugs such that a low immune response was induced, while maintaining maximal anticancer properties. Currently, Doctor Hamilton is the liaison between Penta Medical and the MIBS lab and has developed a photo biomodulation device, which she is currently utilizing to study the therapeutic effect of infrared radiation on corneal epithelial cells to improve the rate of wound healing for both healthy and diabetic patients. All said, our lab will certainly miss Dr. Hamilton when she moves on to be a project coordinator at the Center for Bioengineering and Biotechnology.

          <h3> Even before completing his bachelor’s degree in systems design engineering at UW, Matt began working as a research assistant at the MIBS lab, aiding in various research projects, while still being academically awarded with distinction. Through cooperative education, he was already a versatile worker when beginning at the MIBS lab, having worked in various engineering positions including at Cooper Lighting Controls where he automated the organization’s testing procedure, contributing to the deployment of smart lighting systems. As for his Capstone project, he worked as part of the Secure team to develop an instrument to minimalize the invasiveness of mitral valve repair by creating a device that automates repetitive and complex parts of the surgery. This project is related to his master’s degree research as he is testing a device he developed to predict the outcomes of open heart surgery. To accelerate his progress towards the creation of a point-of-care testing device, he recently went to the University of Technology of Compiegne where he established a research partnership and studied microfluidic design and fabrication techniques.

Concurrently, she not only excelled in her health science classes at the University of Laurier, and acquired numerous academic awards, she also found time to be involved in a variety of associations and societies such as the Pre-Medical Society where she promoted and executed events designed to prepare students for medical school, and was the executive vice-president of the Faculty of Science Students’ Association where she improved the academic, social, and professional experience for her fellow science students. Amidst all of this, she was even involved in another research project on neuromuscular physiology at Laurier where she designed a non-invasive experiment to test cortical inhibition and tested the validity of decomposition electromyography. All in all, Dana has played an important role in recent research at the Material Interaction with Biological Systems Lab.

Prior to her work here, her laboratory assistant position ensured she was well-appointed to her current research position as she has experience cell culturing since she grew the anaerobic microbe, Clostridium Beijerinckii which she analyzed using spectroscopy and gas chromatography to determine their alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme activity and fermentation end products respectively. Currently, she is studying different methods for the collection of closed-eye neutrophils from the ocular surface, examining their interactions with different types of contact lenses, and characterizing them with flow cytometry. Lastly, she is currently a teaching assistant at the School of Optometry and Vision Science which is only fitting as her cheery personality brightens up our lab.

Prior to her work here, she acquired plenty of research experience through completing a project which modeled and optimized the membrane formation parameter with an artificial neural network, and afterwards her experience as a research assistant at the Babol University of Technology where she studied ligand immobilization on high density nanoporous kappa-carrageenan/zinc adsorbents and evaluated their potential for protein nanoparticle separation. Simultaneously, she was acquiring her master’s degree in chemical engineering, focused on biotechnology, in which her thesis was the fabrication and evaluation of high density nano porous adsorbents suitable for high flow rates in the expanded bed process. Through this research, Sadaf has become an expert in adsorbent composite synthesis and characterization, as well as expanded bed chromatography, and has expertise with a variety of lab instruments. Overall, with this knowledge Sadaf is an excellent addition to the MIBS lab.

Prior to her work here, her laboratory assistant position ensured she was well-appointed to her current research position as she has experience cell culturing since she grew the anaerobic microbe, Clostridium Beijerinckii which she analyzed using spectroscopy and gas chromatography to determine their alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme activity and fermentation end products respectively. Currently, she is studying different methods for the collection of closed-eye neutrophils from the ocular surface, examining their interactions with different types of contact lenses, and characterizing them with flow cytometry. Lastly, she is currently a teaching assistant at the School of Optometry and Vision Science which is only fitting as her cheery personality brightens up our lab.

          <h3>While only recently starting at the Material Interaction with Biological Systems lab, Sadaf has been an important catalyst to our latest research. Prior to her work here, she acquired plenty of research experience through completing a project which modeled and optimized the membrane formation parameter with an artificial neural network, and afterwards her experience as a research assistant at the Babol University of Technology where she studied ligand immobilization on high density nanoporous kappa-carrageenan/zinc adsorbents and evaluated their potential for protein nanoparticle separation. Simultaneously, she was acquiring her master’s degree in chemical engineering, focused on biotechnology, in which her thesis was the fabrication and evaluation of high density nano porous adsorbents suitable for high flow rates in the expanded bed process. Through this research, Sadaf has become an expert in adsorbent composite synthesis and characterization, as well as expanded bed chromatography, and has expertise with a variety of lab instruments. Overall, with this knowledge Sadaf is an excellent addition to the MIBS lab.
