          <h2>Maud Gorbet, <br> Biomedical Engineer</h2>
          <h3>With a Ph.D. in Biomedical/Medical Engineering, and research experience as seen through her wealth of research papers and innovations, Doctor Gorbet is well equipped for her position as the Material Interaction with Biological Systems laboratory director. Doctor Gorbet is dedicated to aiding millions of people by solving biocompatibility complications between biomaterials and biomedical devices, as well as therapeutics. Through her research, she has published a series of papers which have benefitted the biomedical community by providing the information and insight necessary to develop novel biomaterials, biomedical devices, and therapeutics, and has provided them with improved in vitro models, which more accurately mimic biological systems to ensure that innovations are successful when implemented in the industry. Meanwhile, as biomedical engineering department director and associate professor at the University of Waterloo, Doctor Gorbet is dedicated to ensuring that the future of biomedical engineering is worth being optimistic about, and that her legacy of biocompatibility will be maintained for years to come.

          <h2>Parisa Hamilton, <br> Chemical Engineer</h2>
          <h3> Through a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering at the University of Tehran, a master’s degree in chemical engineering, and a PhD in nanotechnological chemical engineering at the University of Waterloo, Doctor Hamilton has acquired the knowledge that has allowed her to excel at the MIBS lab. This is complimented by the wisdom she has attained through working as a research assistant and associate at the University of Waterloo, completing numerous projects. For instance, for her doctoral thesis, she developed self-assembling peptide based nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery to stabilize hydrophobic drugs such that a low immune response was induced, while maximal anticancer properties were maintained. Currently, Doctor Hamilton is the liaison between Penta Medical and the MIBS lab and has developed a photo biomodulation device, which she is currently utilizing to study the therapeutic effect of infrared radiation on corneal epithelial cells to improve the rate of wound healing for both healthy and diabetic patients.

          <h2>Matthew Robichaud, <br> Bioengineer</h2>
          <h3> Even before completing his bachelor’s degree in systems design engineering at the University of Waterloo, Matt began working as a research assistant at the MIBS lab, developing assays, researching contact lenses as a vehicle for controlled drug release, studying mechanobiology, and utilizing immunofluorescent confocal microscopy and flow cytometry to aid in various forms of research. Through cooperative education, he was already a versatile worker when beginning at the MIBS lab, having worked in various engineering positions including in Eaton’s lighting department leading the product testing for the North American research and development team.  As for his Capstone project, he worked as part of the Secure team to develop an instrument to minimalize the invasiveness of mitral valve repair by developing a device that automates repetitive and complex parts of the surgery. This project is related to his master’s degree research in which he is testing a device he developed to predict the outcomes of cardiopulmonary bypasses, and eventually develop a point-of-care testing device.

Concurrently, she not only excelled in her health science classes at the University of Laurier, and acquired numerous academic awards, she also found time to be involved in a variety of associations and societies such as the Pre-Medical Society where she promoted and executed events designed to prepare students for medical school, and was the executive vice-president of the Faculty of Science Students’ Association where she sought to improve the academic, social, and professional experience for her fellow science students. Amidst all of this, she was even involved in another research project on neuromuscular physiology at Laurier where she designed a non-invasive experiment to test cortical inhibition and tested the validity of decomposition electromyography. Needless to say, Dana has played an important role in recent research at the Material Interaction with Biological Systems Lab.

Prior to her work here, she acquired plenty of research experience through her work as an undergraduate researcher, completing a project which modeled and optimized the membrane formation parameter with an artificial neural network, and afterwards her experience as a research assistant at the Babol University of Technology where she studied ligand immobilization on high density nanoporous kappa-carrageenan/zinc adsorbents and evaluated their potential for protein nanoparticle separation as part of the nanotechnology research institute. Simultaneously, she was acquiring her master’s degree in chemical engineering, focused on biotechnology, in which her thesis was the fabrication and evaluation of high density nano porous adsorbents suitable for high flow rates in the expanded bed process. Through this research, Sadaf has become an expert in adsorbent composite synthesis and characterization, as well as expanded bed chromatography, and has expertise with a variety of lab instruments. Overall, with this knowledge Sadaf is an excellent addition to the MIBS lab.

          <h3>While only recently starting at the Material Interaction with Biological Systems lab, Sadaf has been an important catalyst to new confidential research. Prior to her work here, she acquired plenty of research experience through her work as an undergraduate researcher, completing a project which modeled and optimized the membrane formation parameter with an artificial neural network, and afterwards her experience as a research assistant at the Babol University of Technology where she studied ligand immobilization on high density nanoporous kappa-carrageenan/zinc adsorbents and evaluated their potential for protein nanoparticle separation as part of the nanotechnology research institute. Simultaneously, she was acquiring her master’s degree in chemical engineering, focused on biotechnology, in which her thesis was the fabrication and evaluation of high density nano porous adsorbents suitable for high flow rates in the expanded bed process. Through this research, Sadaf has become an expert in adsorbent composite synthesis and characterization, as well as expanded bed chromatography, and has expertise with a variety of lab instruments. Overall, with this knowledge Sadaf is an excellent addition to the MIBS lab.
