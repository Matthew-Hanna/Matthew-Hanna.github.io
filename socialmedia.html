        <div class="biotext">
          During my first term at the University of Waterloo, I led a team of 4 to simplify the process of learning to ride a bicycle. Initally, we developed our first report which explained why this issue was viable, and generated proof of concept models. For our second report and presentation, we developed a primary functional model and evaluated it with tests. Finally, we took our incites and published a final report, developed a functional prototype, and conducted tests to verify that it achieved our goal.

        <div class="biotext">
          With a team of 4, I developed various recommendations to improve the infusion pump from a Human Factors perspective, and developed various prototypes that responded to the concerns posed primarily by the FDA. I believe the most fruitful of our prototypes was the concept of an application. The concept of the application is to alert nurses via their cellphone to ensure the patient has a quieter environment, and provide the nurse with useful status updates presented by the infusion pump along with other devices to ensure that a nurse can quickly monitor the status of their patients.

        <div class="biotext">
          At TRIUMF in Vancouver, British Columbia, I was certified to work as a Nuclear Energy Worker to install a system designed to assess the ability of fiber optics to measure a proton beam's beam current, trajectory, and shape. I also developed a program in Python to bypass the use of an expensive fiber switch and to implement pattern recognition and data analysis algorithms to allow for the easy interpretation of the results. During my time there I also troubleshooted and tested fiber optical probes and amplifiers to measure localized temperature and pressure within a target, both of which had never been successfully done before.

          During my co-op position at the Material Interactions with Biological Systems lab at the Univerisity of Waterloo, I developed a website over the course of two weeks to publicize the research that has been occurring, and give credit to the participating reserachers through self-learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
